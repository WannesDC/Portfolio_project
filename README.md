This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

In essence this project is an application which you can use to generate your own portfolio without needing any knowledge at all surrounding IT. All you need to be able to do is register an account, fill in some forms, and voila, your portfolio will be generated for you!

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server that includes all custom scripts that are needed on launch (ie: proxy.conf.json). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `wwwroot/` directory of `dotnet_backend` . Only Use this with `--prod`, the flag that indicates this is the production build.

## Running cypress tests

Run `npx cypress open` to run your cypress tests, in development mode.
